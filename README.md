Note: GrabCAD was refusing to let me login, so please excuse the crude models I have made as replacements.
Note 2: Please see Controller Letter Showcase. It is an early version PNG file that shows how each letter was included.
The Red is the E that was used (Edward), and the Blue is the D that was used (Dressler).

With regards to the un-beveled middle section; the circular part of the D shape; Fusion was, for reason unknown, refusing to bevel that specific part along with the rest of the controller. I believe that the possible cause for this might lay in how I built it using multiple different sketches, but without more troubleshooting I remain uncertain.

Controller Explanation: 

What was done: I made a controller using the E and D from my initials. The D was chosen because it would make for a nice and comfortable round shape, whilst still allowing for a flatter portion for circuitry related items such as the breadboard. The E letter was chosen because it would allow for some "arms" for the buttons, joystick, and pressure sensors to stay on while still leaving room for the user's fingers.

By creating a shape that would both have a solid center portion to support the breadboard, while leaving enough room in-between the main D and the E's arms for the user's fingers, they should be able to curl their fingers around the controller while still having their index and thumbs resting in a comfortable position.

How was done: I initially started by trying to use the R and D initials, but quickly found that there was going to be no suitable shape for the R to fit. Once I moved to the E letter, I realized that by setting the D on a 90 degree angle that I could create a controller reminiscent to the PlayStation 1? (that controller with a thumbstick in the middle that makes absolutely no sense). I would be trying to invert the design to make it more user friendly, and provide the controller with "arms" that their middle, ring, and pinkie fingers could easily fit around. Afterwards I carved out the inside of the controller and duplicated it (one top half and one bottom half).

I then carved a small pillar that the breadboard would be able to sit upon without moving about, and some small pillars that could support the thumbsticks. The whole on the controller is intended to be hot glue gunned together, once all of the internal circuitry is in place (space was left in order to make setting the individual pieces both easier, while still leaving room for them to be glue gunned in place).
